# Solarpowergeneration-DataAnalysis
The main aim in this project is to perform data analysis tasks with the help of the [official pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html).

It is performed on Solar Power Energy Generation dataset obtained from Kaggle - [Solar energy power generation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stucom/solar-energy-power-generation-dataset).

Tasks performed here include - 
1. Grouped Means and Aggregated Calculations and Grouped Frequency Counts
2. Data Structures in Pandas and its functionalities
3. Duplication Label Detection and removal
4. Time Series Analysis

All these tasks are performed on the dataset obtained from Kaggle.
